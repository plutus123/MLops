### Step 2:Docker Containerization

In this step, we'll containerize the machine learning model along with its dependencies using Docker. This will allow for consistent and reproducible deployment across different environments.

## Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` contains instructions to build the Docker image. It specifies the base image, sets the working directory, copies necessary files, installs required packages, and defines the command to run the application.

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the machine learning code and dataset into the container at /app
COPY MLops.ipynb /app/
COPY Social_Network_Ads.csv /app/

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir scikit-learn pandas

# Command to run the machine learning script
CMD ["python", "MLops.ipynb"]
```
Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, execute the following command in your terminal:


```
docker build -t vishwasmishra/mlops_image:v1 .
```
This command instructs Docker to build an image based on the instructions in the Dockerfile and tag it as vishwasmishra/mlops_image:v1.

Running the Docker Image

You can run the Docker image with the following command:

```
docker run vishwasmishra/mlops_image:v1
```
This command starts a container using the vishwasmishra/mlops_image:v1 image, which will execute the machine learning script specified in the Dockerfile.

Pushing the Docker Image
If you want to share your Docker image, you can push it to a container registry like Docker Hub. To do so, follow these steps:

1.Log in to Docker Hub using the command docker login.

2.Tag the image with your Docker Hub username:

```
docker tag vishwasmishra/mlops_image:v1 vishwasmishra/mlops_image:v1
```

Push the image to Docker Hub:
```
docker push vishwasmishra/mlops_image:v1
```

Please remember to replace `vishwasmishra/mlops_image:v1` with your actual Docker Hub repository and image name. Additionally, make sure that the Dockerfile and the required files (`MLops.ipynb` and `Social_Network_Ads.csv`) are in the same directory as your README.md file.

## Step 4: Automated Testing

Automated testing has been set up to ensure the reliability of the machine learning code.

### Unit Tests

The repository includes unit tests to verify the functionality of the machine learning code. These tests cover critical components and edge cases.

To run the unit tests locally, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_mlops.py
Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline
A CI pipeline has been configured using [Testing Service Name]. The pipeline automatically runs the unit tests on every push to the repository.

Test results can be viewed in the CI/CD pipeline on [Testing Service Name]. A badge indicating the build status may be added to the README file.
